# Growing Shapes

Utilize circles, squares, and triangles to create modern art with a randomized color palette and an alterable growing rate.

Instructions: Click anywhere to start growing a shape. Default is a circle, but you can change the shape by clicking 1 for circle, 2 for square, and 3 for triangle on your keyboard. You can also increase the rate of your shape growing with the up arrow key or decrease the rate with the down arrow key.
